Ethernet Switch
---------------

The INS-8648(W) is a Managed Industrial Switch perfectly suited for industrial network applications
which require managed devices that offer hassle-free fiber deployment and an ideal solution to deploy
in automation systems. The switch’s rugged IP30 aluminum case and hardened components withstand in operating
temperatures from 0°C to 70°C (INS-8648) or wide operating temperature from -40°C to 75°C (INS-8648W).

The INS-8648(W) features with 4-slot Gigabit SFP which immune to moisture, static electricity,
power surges and short circuits, plus 8 10/100/1000Base-T ports. Switch is also equipped with a variety of
management functions that let you configure communication parameters as you desire and monitor the network
behavior in number of different simple ways. In addition, the switch is built with dual redundant power inputs
to ensure reliability and maximize network up time. Other integrated features of the switch such as Rate limitation,
Port Isolation etc., optimizes your network performance and provide a secure network, offering a cost-effective
solution in a small but powerful package.

Arduino board A
---------------

This board controls the power module. It controls the power of 13 devices. We have enabled the on-board watchdog
function for all three Arduino boards in EBOX.

:IP: 10.1.164.97
:MAC: 90:a2:da:0f:87:05

This is current pin assignment for outputs. The default digital outputs is low for Arduino board. So for AG cameras,
the power is off when we set the digital output to low. For other devices, the situation is reversed, the power is
off when we set the output to high.

We can use telnet protocol to send commands: ‘Q’ for query, ‘P’ for pulse and ’S’ for set. For pulse command ‘P’,
the format is ‘PXXXX’, ‘XXXX’ is the devices to cut off power for one second. This command won’t do any thing
for a device in OFF state. For set command ’S', the format is ‘SXXXXYYYY’. ‘XXXX’ is the mask to specify which
devices to set, ‘YYYY’ is the value to set. For query command ‘Q’, it returns current status.

There are also three commands for monitoring the network switch: ‘MONITORSET’ to set the switch IP, ‘MONITORON’
to turn on this function and ‘MONITOROFF’ to turn off this function. The default setting is OFF. If you turn on
this function, once it failed to ping the network switch, it will turn off the network switch
for one second in order to reboot this device.

Base on current design, there is only one telnet client can connectat the same time, other telnet clients must wait
until available. Also, if a telnet client doesn’t issue any command for more than 10s, then it will be disconnected.

This board connects to the humidity sensor, flow meter and leakage detector. We can program it to use DHCP or static IP.

:IP: 10.1.164.98
:MAC: 90:a2:da:0f:87:03

There are two ways to read the data:

**Telnet protocol**
  Only support ‘Q’ command for query.

::

  > telnet 10.1.194.98
  :Q
  Temperature = 25.80 C, Humidity = 68.61 %, Dewpoint = 19.59 C
  Flow = 0 Hz
  Liquid leakage 1, disconnection 1
  :X

We can use telnet to send commands to this board.

::

  # Send (a) or (b) to switch between two different LED modes
   :a     # turn on for 10.24us, turn off for 89.64us, period is 0.1ms

Adam 6015
---------

The ADAM-6015 is a 16-bit, 7-channel RTD input module that provides programmable input ranges on all
channels. It accepts various RTD inputs (PT100, PT1000, Balco 500 & Ni) and provides data to the host
computer in engineering units (°C). In order to satisfy various temperature requirements in one module,
each analog channel is allowed to configure an individual range for several applications.

There are total three such modules inside EBox, so we have total 3x7=21 RTD sensors. This module
supports Modbus/TCP Protocol and following is the function to read RTD sensors. A python module has been
built to get the temperature readings. It doesn’t support DHCP and SNMP protocols.

Function Code 03/04
  The function code 03 or 04 is used to read the binary contents of input registers

  Request message format for function code 03 or 04:

  +-----------------+---------------+-------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
  | Station Address | Function Code | Start Address High Byte | Start Address Low Byte | Requested Number of Register High Byte | Requested Number of Register Low Byte |
  +-----------------+---------------+-------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+

  Example: Read Analog inputs #1 and #2 in addresses 40001 to 40002 as floating point value from ADAM-6017 module

  ::

    01 04 00 01 00 02

  Response message format for function code 03 or 04:

  +-----------------+---------------+------------+------+------+-----+
  | Station Address | Function Code | Byte Count | Data | Data | ... |
  +-----------------+---------------+------------+------+------+-----+

  Example: Analog input #1 and #2 as floating point values where AI#1=100.0 and AI#2=55.32

Power-On sequence for USB devices in EBOX
-----------------------------------------

1. Connect the power cable to EBOX
2. Wait for a while for the ethernet switch and board A to boot
3. Turn on AGC computer, during boot process, the USB hubs should be detected by kernel.
4. Now you can use the USB devices like AG cameras and USB microphone
